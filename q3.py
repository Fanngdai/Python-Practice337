# One Step Ahead [20 pts]
# Your model should work well in theory, but it has a problem: Too many people know what
# you know, and you canâ€™t profit using this strategy. You need to step up your game.
# What if you were able to read and analyze finance news automatically and use it to
# improve your trading models? This will be faster than a human reading the news and it
# may give you the edge.

# Question. Write a program to parse and get the titles, source(e.g., Wall Street
# Journal) and the date(e.g., 1 hour ago) of all articles from
# https://finance.google.com/finance/market_news. The program returns the a list of
# lists, where each list contains the title, source and the date of an article. Write
# all these to a file named top10articles.txt, one line for each article, and with comma
# separated values(e.g., title,source,date )[20 pts]. Hint: You do not have to use
# BeautifulSoup for this, but it may make things much easier.
