# Question 6 part 3 of Homework 1

# Coding for Fun[15 pts]
# Part 3. Write a recursive function to calculate and print all interleavings of two
# lists. The main property of interleavings is that the order of elements in the
# individual lists are preserved. For example, for inputs [1,2] and [3,4], your program
# should result in [1,2,3,4],[1,3,4,2],[1,3,2,4],[3,4,1,2],[3,1,2,4],[3,1,4,2]. [3 pts].
